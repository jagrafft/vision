- "Monad loop" closing effectively
    - Implemented `Folktale<Task>` for for WebSocket replies
    - `find` returns `error` or `result` only
- Encapsulation of functionality provided by monad implementation is prefereable.
- Need better definition of `Task -> Result -> ... -> Task` chain
    - Current structure is an improvement, not "what I need" yet
