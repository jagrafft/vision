Making small edits for upcoming refactors; for the immediate future more will change in Cortex.

It seems a two-way WebSocket driver would be beneficial as I add UI interactivity. I like the element-data coupling Cycle provides, and it has been convenient for getting information rendered on the page--allowing some of those elements to make an easy WebSocket call seems natural, especially as I consider using Monocle as a component of a larger application.

I am making a switch in the data packet to include the value `key`, representing the "trigger word" used by Monocle's XStream filters for catching new data. I believe this will allow better separation of concerns on the backend.
